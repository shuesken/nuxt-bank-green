                    It's hard to believe, but in the 6 years since 197 countries
                    agreed to drastically reduce their greenhouse gas emissions
                    as part of the Paris Climate Agreement, big banks have
                    provided $4.6 trillion to support the environmental
                    destruction caused by the fossil fuel industry.

                    <br /><br /><img class="h-20 mr-4 float-left" style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 0px"
                        src="/img/certification/certified.png"
                        alt="Fossil-Free Seal for Eco Banks & Sustainable Banks" />

                    Of the financial institutions you can find below, those
                    denoted with the symbol pictured here form part of our
                    Fossil Free Alliance. These banks and credit unions have all
                    gone on record as stating that going forward, they will play
                    no part in the provision of loans, underwriting or
                    investments to aid the expansion of fossil fuel extraction,
                    production or infrastructure - and in the majority of cases,
                    they never have.

                    <br /><br />Those green banks and credit unions who appear
                    below but are not part of the alliance may very well have
                    the same credentials as those who are - it could just be
                    that we have not approached them yet, but we are working on
                    it! While we cannot provide a guarantee as to the level of
                    their environmental credentials, to the best of our
                    knowledge they are committed to working on their social and
                    environmental impact.

                    <br /><br />To understand more about why we consider
                    divestment from fossil fuels in particular such a critical
                    part of the fight against climate change,
                    <a href="/certification">visit our page</a> describing our
                    reasons for creating this alliance and what we hope to
                    accomplish with it.

                    <br /><br />If you think your own green financial
                    institution would be eligible to join, we would love for you
                    to ask them to reach out to us at hello@bank.green.
