We do urge you to try calling first, for the biggest impact. If you don't feel comfortable doing that, however, then writing an email or a letter is still a great step you can take.

This template has been created to inspire you, but please write something in your words, with specific information about the bank you are addressing. Original emails or letters can make a bigger impact. Companies quickly develop automation strategies to deal with waves of templated emails or letters, but these strategies cannot be applied to unique ones. This means that personalizing your message will make handling and responding to it more time-consuming for the bank, so you'll make a bigger impact.

If it is your own bank you are addressing, you should of course customize it as such, and can also verbiage about being prepared to move your money out, if indeed you are.

> Dear XXX,

> I am writing to you because I am increasingly concerned about your investment decisions and what this means for your customers' money.

> I have recently discovered that your engagement with the fossil fuels industry continues, with nothing to suggest that you are making sufficient changes to align with a sustainable planet. It is now extremely clear that the extraction and burning of fossil fuels is heating our planet. If this activity is not halted, our futures will become increasingly unstable. I am sure you can appreciate that I would not want mine or anyone else's personal funds to be contributing to such a future.
>
> Furthermore, supporting an industry with declining prospects does not seem economically viable.
>
> This activity leads me to question your decision-making, as well as your regard for me as a customer/potential customer.
>
> I would like to know if you plan to stop enabling the extraction and burning of fossil fuels. If you do intend to stop, please lay out your plan and the timeline to me.
>
> I look forward to hearing from you soon.
>
> Yours sincerely,
>
