**It has been proved over and over again that people power creates change.** Some would say itâ€™s the _only_ thing that creates change. So, whatever your personal banking situation and intentions are, this is your guide to applying your unique brand of pressure to the industry.

If you take only one action while visiting our site today, we hope it will be to sign the Bank.Green pledge to move your money away from fossil banks:

Even if you are still tied into a financial product with your current bank, your **pledge** is what matters. Every name we gather represents another person who is prepared to claw their money back from the fossil fuel industry. The longer this list grows, the more powerful we become - and the harder we'll be to ignore.

If you're not ready to move your money now or in the future, or if you already bank sustainably, the very best way to turn up the heat up on the banks is to let them know your concerns:

### **Start a conversation with a fossil bank**

Start a conversation? That doesn't exactly sound action-packed. What's that going to achieve?

Well, we think this action is vital. If enough customers, or potential customers, make it clear that they are unhappy and alarmed by a bank's financing of fossil fuels, the bank will feel the pressure to either change, or face losing customers. The more conversations, the more pressure.

There are a few ways you can start such a conversation. Before you get in touch, we encourage you to [check how the bank ranks for fossil fuel financing](https://bank.green/). If you mention this information when you talk to the bank, it will be difficult for them to change the subject.
