So, you just found out that your bank is pouring money into fossil fuels like it’s Champagne on a Formula 1 podium. Maybe you dug deeper with our partner, [BankTrack](https://www.banktrack.org/project/line_3_pipeline_replacement_project), to read that your bank did something along the lines of "participate as a joint lead manager" for a new coal-fired power station, or "facilitate a bond issuance" for an oil pipeline. Hmmm.

It all sounds formal and dull, doesn’t it? But this could not be further from the truth. That’s why we want to tell you the stories of these projects, starting with North America’s Line 3 pipeline.

The Line 3 "Replacement" Project is the latest battle in the region’s bitter pipeline war. It pits a long list of the world’s biggest banks, an enormous energy company, and tar sands oil extraction, against vulnerable natural environments, defenders of Indigenous lands, and the fight to prevent runaway global heating. President Biden just blocked the notorious Keystone XL pipeline, which has intensified the spotlight on Line 3. If this pipeline fulfills its purpose, the resulting emissions from burning the extracted oil would be unprecedented, fueling dangerous levels of global heating.

## The Enbridge Tar Sands Saga

The goal of the Line 3 pipeline project is to "replace" a pre-existing pipeline. Line 3 is one of six pipelines that pump tar sands oil from Alberta in Canada to Superior in Wisconsin, USA. The Canadian half of the new Line 3 was completed in December 2019, while construction of the final USA section began in December 2020, in Minnesota.

This final section threatens important wildlife habitats, such as wetlands and waterways, and cuts through treaty lands of the Anishinaabe peoples and nations, harming wild rice fields that have nourished generations. An oil leak could wreck all of this.

Tar sands oil is a particularly carbon-intensive oil, found among sand and clay. Extracting tar sands oil is more expensive, more time-consuming, and has a larger negative impact on the local environment than conventional oil extraction via wells.

The volume of greenhouse gases emitted during the burning of tar sands oil is so massive that some banks refuse to do business with it, [including BNP Paribas](https://group.bnpparibas/en/press-release/bnp-paribas-takes-measures-accelerate-support-energy-transition). If the new Line 3 fulfils its purpose, [350 Minnesota calculates that](https://mn350.org/giant-step-backward/) the additional greenhouse gas emissions would be equivalent to that of 50 coal-fired power plants, or another 38 million gas-powered cars on the road.

The six tar sands oil pipelines that run from Alberta to Wisconsin are operated by [Enbridge Inc.](https://www.enbridge.com/about-us), an energy delivery company based in Calgary, Canada.

Enbridge says that the ageing Line 3 has approximately 900 "structural anomalies," which means things like small holes and cracks. In essence, Line 3 has reached the end of its life and is corroding.

The company refers to this job as the [Line 3 Replacement Project](https://www.enbridge.com/projects-and-infrastructure/projects/line-3-replacement-program-us), but this name can be seen as misleading. Opponents have argued that "replacement" implies that the project is a) simply a repair job, b) not an expansion of fossil fuel production, and c) not going to disrupt untouched environments. As you will discover below, the opposite is true.

## Why Line 3?

We’ve picked the Line 3 project because so many banks are financing it, which means that there’s a good chance your bank is among them. A lot of banks are implicated because Enbridge hasn’t established a project-specific fund for the Line 3 pipeline, instead drawing from its general funds.

Furthermore, the sheer scale of Line 3’s funding is a good example of how the tentacles of one fossil fuel project quickly spread out across the world.

Finally, we’ve decided to shine a light on Line 3 because we are frankly shocked that such an irresponsible project is in operation: climate change denialism is fading and the world is aware of [the dangers we face if global heating continues](https://www.ipcc.ch/static/infographic/worlds-apart/).

## So, which banks are financing it?

BankTrack is dedicated to tracking the details of deals made by private-sector commercial banks that power environmental destruction. [The Line 3 project is currently one of BankTrack’s "priority campaign targets"](https://www.banktrack.org/project/line_3_pipeline_replacement_project#financiers), so there is a lot of information available on where Line 3’s money has been coming from.

In October 2017, a \$1.48 billion USD credit facility [led by Wells Fargo](https://www.banktrack.org/project/line_3_pipeline_replacement_project#financiers) was renewed for Line 3. A credit facility is a large pile of money that a debtor can periodically draw upon, which avoids the hassle of repeatedly applying for smaller loans. Although Wells Fargo was the main character in this deal, it was backed up by a vast supporting cast of banks, each joining in to make money off of this project.
