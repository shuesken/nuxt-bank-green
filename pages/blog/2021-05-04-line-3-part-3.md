These numbers are mind-blowing. It’s easy to become desensitized to the word ‘billion’, but seeing 2.975 billion written in full should help:

2,975,000,000.

Dollars.

Yikes.

## How popular is this project?

If it was entered into a beauty pageant, the Line 3 "replacement" pipeline probably wouldn’t win Miss Congeniality. Here are just four of the issues:

### 1. What happens to the old Line 3 pipe?

[Enbridge says…](https://www.enbridge.com/projects-and-infrastructure/projects/line-3-replacement-program-canada) _generally speaking, Enbridge leaves a decommissioned line in place to avoid major construction activities, and to reduce the risk of soil stability issues that could compromise the integrity of operating pipelines sharing the right-of-way._

[The campaign group Stop Line 3 says…](https://www.stopline3.org/issues/#abandonment) _the pipeline likely has many sites of contaminated soil and water around it already, from old leaks and spills, and the worsening "structural anomaly" problem. Pipeline abandonment also has an enormous hydrological impact. And as it corrodes, the pipe will slowly allow water to enter, and eventually transform into a water conduit that could easily drain a wetland or small lake, or flood a farm field._

### 2. What about the land rights of Minnesota’s Indigenous Chippewa?

[Enbridge says…](https://www.enbridge.com/about-us/our-values/indigenous-communities) _at Enbridge, we are committed to early engagement and meaningful dialog with Indigenous peoples along our pipeline rights-of-way, based on mutual respect and trust._

[The Supreme Court of the United States says…](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/97-1337.ZO.html) _we conclude that the Chippewa retain the usufructuary rights guaranteed to them under the 1837 Treaty._

_Explainer: In 1837, the US entered into a treaty with several Bands of Chippewa Indians, which meant the Indians ceded land in present-day Wisconsin and Minnesota. In return, the government guaranteed that the Indians would continue to have certain hunting, fishing, and gathering rights on the ceded land. This treaty was upheld by the Supreme Court during a 1999 legal battle. Were Line 3 to leak, it would threaten the future of hunting, fishing, and gathering on these lands, thereby violating this treaty. It’s therefore difficult to believe that Enbridge is acting with ‘respect and trust’, especially considering that [the company spilled 800,000 gallons of oil into Talmadge Creek and the Kalamazoo River near Marshall, Michigan in 2010](https://www.fws.gov/midwest/oilspill/continuedassessment.htm) (pictured above)._

### 3. Is this an expansion?

[Enbridge says…](https://www.enbridge.com/projects-and-infrastructure/public-awareness/minnesota-projects/line-3-replacement-project) _in the U.S., the replacement pipeline will follow Enbridge's existing Line 3 route from Joliette, North Dakota to Clearbrook, Minnesota, and then will primarily follow existing pipeline and transmission routes from Clearbrook to Superior, Wisconsin._

[BankTrack says…](https://www.banktrack.org/project/line_3_pipeline_replacement_project) _The replacement Line 3 would take a brand new route. This path cuts through pristine wetlands and watersheds in northern Minnesota, passing through the headwaters of the Mississippi River to the shores of Lake Superior, through the heart of Minnesota’s lake country and some of the largest and most productive wild rice beds in the world._

### 4. What about climate change?

[Enbridge spokesperson Juli Kellner says…](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/apr/06/banks-climate-change-line-3-pipeline-conflict-interest) _It is our responsibility to do what we can to address climate change. That is why we’ve set a target of net-zero emissions by 2050 and laid a credible path to achieving it, including tying compensation of our executives to our performance in this area._

[Reclaim Finance says...](https://reclaimfinance.org/site/en/2021/03/10/enbridge-sustainable-credit-tar-sands-rights-violations/) _Enbridge’s greenhouse gas reduction and net-zero targets do not apply to what represents the lion’s share of its emissions: the use of the products it sells to utility companies and the electricity grid transmission and distribution losses. Enbridge itself writes that its reduction targets apply to less than 2% of the lifecycle emission intensity of oil sands._

[Former NASA climate scientist James Hansen says…](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/10/opinion/game-over-for-the-climate.html) _Canada’s tar sands, deposits of sand saturated with bitumen, contain twice the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by global oil use in our [humanity’s] entire history._

## End Game

Project-specific arguments aside, humanity cannot afford to continue extracting and burning fossil fuels. The more greenhouse gases that are in the atmosphere, the hotter our planet becomes.

We can’t put it better than Minnesota’s Jami Gaither, who lives in the pathway of the new Line 3 pipeline and [recently said this to The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/apr/06/banks-climate-change-line-3-pipeline-conflict-interest):

> How much longer can we keep up this charade, this idea that we can keep going on developing fossil fuels? We’re building a fucking tar sands pipeline at the end of the world.

Like many of us, Jami Gaither understands that this is the fight for our lives. If global heating is not stopped and reversed, we face food insecurity and higher levels of starvation, the obliteration of small island states, huge public unrest and migration, and increasingly extreme weather events.

## Find your own power

If you wish to familiarize yourself with recent efforts to halt North America’s fossil fuel pipelines, we recommend an April 2021 episode of the How to Save a Planet podcast, called [The Fight to Stop Oil Pipelines: "For Water. For Treaties. For Climate"](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/howtosaveaplanet/76h4r25/the-fight-to-stop-oil-pipelines-for).

The episode includes an interview with [Tara Houska](https://www.ted.com/speakers/tara_houska), a Couchiching First Nation American and attorney, who has been on the front line of these efforts for many years. Tara’s testimony and advocacy is compelling, not to mention inspirational.

Houska is a member of the steering committee for the Stop the Money Pipeline coalition, which launched its [Defund Line 3 campaign](https://stopthemoneypipeline.com/line3/) in February 2021. The campaign has been responsible for a steady wave of actions against the banks financing Line 3, such as the protest pictured below, at Wells Fargo HQ in San Francisco. Stop the Money Pipeline’s next move is a [Day of Action on Friday 7 May](https://actionnetwork.org/event_campaigns/defundline3-global-day-of-action).

Houska, who five years ago played a key role in the momentous Standing Rock protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline and currently lives at a Line 3 resistance camp, shared this message during her How to Save a Planet interview:

> Colonisation and genocide nearly wiped all of us [First Nation Americans] off the face of the earth but we’re still here and so, the bravest thing that I think people can do is actually stand with us. That’s using privilege, access, your own agency, finding your own power, and being empowered.

In the face of enormous corporate interest and armies of banks lining up to provide finance, we believe that mass people power is essential in putting an end to fossil fuel projects like Line 3. None of them could be built without our money.

As Houska says, it’s time to make a stand. Bank.Green exists to make a stand against the banking industry, which continues to finance environmental catastrophe. Find out if your bank is supporting fossil fuel infrastructure [here](https://bank.green) and take action with our growing movement [here](https://bank.green/take-action).

It is now up to us to say that projects such as Enbridge’s Line 3 pipeline are no longer acceptable, because the world’s biggest banks cannot be trusted to say it themselves.
