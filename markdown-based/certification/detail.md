#### Benefits of Certification

-   Attract customers and employees: Customers — especially younger ones — are increasingly concerned about climate change and making consumer choices that prioritize sustainability. Likewise, more and more millennial and Gen Z professionals consider a company's social and environmental impact when evaluating job satisfaction or considering new employers. Fossil Free Certification signals an important commitment to sustainability and halting the climate crisis.
-   Access networks: By becoming Fossil Free Certified, you join a community of banking industry leaders similarly dedicated to sustainability. Bank.Green hosts regular events and opportunities to network and engage with other members of our Fossil Free Banking Alliance.
-   Provide public relations benefits: Bank.Green works alongside Fossil Free Certified members to generate publicity around the commitment they've made to stop further financing of fossil fuels.
-   Join a movement: The movement against fossil fuel finance — and for sustainable investments — is growing at a rapid rate, as industries, social movements, and the general public increasingly consider climate-friendly finance a critical subject. Take your place as a leader of this powerful, all-important movement by becoming a certified member of our Fossil Free Banking Alliance.
