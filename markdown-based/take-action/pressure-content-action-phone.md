Calling is an excellent way to begin a conversation a fossil bank. It might evolve into emails or letters, but your initial call is likely to cause a significant reaction. That's because multiple employees may become involved, as they try to establish who you should talk to and how best to respond.

Calls from customers about this kind of issue are still rare, so your call will stand out. It may very well even prompt staff at the bank to start asking these questions, too.

In terms of where to call, we find that calling the bankâ€™s investor relations department (usually found on the website) can give the best results, as the employees here tend to have a direct line of communication to senior management. With that said, calling the customer service line is still a great option and absolutely worth doing!

We suggest making notes on what you would like to say, so you feel relaxed and ready. Try calling early or late, when you'll probably be connected soonest.

Here is some inspiration:

-   I have become aware that [name of bank] is financing fossil fuel companies and projects. I don't think customers' money should be used in ways that are incompatible with a sustainable future. Can I please talk to somebody about this?
-   I think that my money is being used to finance the fossil fuels industry. Who can I speak with to raise my concerns about this?
-   I don't think non-renewable energy investment is a sustainable, long-term strategy, which makes me concerned about the risks being taken with your customers' money.

If you're given an email address and asked to write instead, say the following before the call ends, as it will help to maximise the impact of your phone call:

-   Could you please pass my message along, and log my call for a follow-up?

The call logging is important, as the more calls that are logged, the more the higher-ups will have to take notice.

Lastly, don't worry if you feel nervous - we've made these calls ourselves and nerves are totally normal! Nerves are also a good thing, because whoever you speak to will recognise that you're genuine and human, just like them.
