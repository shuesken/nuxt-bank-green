-   Call or email your old bank's customer service department and ask for them to close your account. Ask to receive written confirmation of the closure, by email or letter, so you can be sure your account was actually closed.

-   Switching to a bank that doesn't finance fossil fuels is a hugely important climate action in and of itself. But the action can be amplified greatly by letting your old bank know why you are leaving them. After all, if you move your money but don't tell your old bank why, they won't feel any pressure to change.

If you choose to do this while on the phone with your bank's customer service, be sure to ask them to log your concern along with the closure. For maximum impact, however, we suggest also asking them for the appropriate email address to write to, then sending a customized version of the below template:

> **_Dear XXX,_**
>
> **_I recently closed my [bank name] accounts and I would like to explain why._**
>
> **_While I was your customer, I became increasingly concerned over your continued engagement with the fossil fuels industry. [Thousands of scientists from around the world](https://www.ipcc.ch/about/structure/) have said that if we continue to heat Earth's atmosphere by burning fossil fuels, it will become increasingly difficult to live on this planet. I do not want my money to enable such a future, so I decided to put it elsewhere._**
>
> **_My wish is for my actions and this letter to make [bank name] urgently reconsider its activities. If [bank name] invests for the good of our environment, it will in turn be investing in its customers, not to mention its business._**
>
> **_I hope that it doesn't take many more messages like mine for [bank name] to stop investing in environmentally destructive activities, such as the extraction and burning of fossil fuels. These decisions are no longer morally responsible or financially viable._**
>
> **_I look forward to hearing from you on this matter._**
>
> **_Yours sincerely, XXXX_**
>
> **_Account number: XXXXXXXX_**

Lastly, letting your new bank or credit union know why you are joining them will encourage them to speak up more about the impact of fossil fuel finance. It will also put further pressure on the fossil banks to reform.
