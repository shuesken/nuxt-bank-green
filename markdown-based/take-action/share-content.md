### Share the message

**Every effective mass movement is a numbers game, so let's give the fossil banks some figures that they won't enjoy analyzing: increasing the percentages of customers calling them out.** To pull this off, we need you to advocate, advocate, advocate. Find out how to help swell our movement here.

#### Talk to your friends, family, and followers

Bank.Green knows that listening to a concerned individual who you care about is more powerful than listening to the messaging of a campaign group. That's why encouraging people to talk to their own banks is at the core of this movement.

The same can be applied to personal relationships. Your friends, family, and social media circle will listen to you much more carefully than they will listen to us.
