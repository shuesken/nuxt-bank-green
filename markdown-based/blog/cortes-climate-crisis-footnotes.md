[1]: This is presented in the way that modern-day “equity owner” arrangements typically are structured. Cortés' conquest took place before the invention of the joint-stock company and so they, unlike modern-day “equity owners,” did not have the ability to directly vote for their conquest’s management.

[2]: A company typically pays debt holders before equity holders. Even in bankruptcy, a company’s assets (gold, ships, slaves, oil rigs, etc) will be sold off to the highest bidder to partially pay back the debts holders.

[4]: Most people "hold equity" through financial intermediaries like "Vanguard" and "BlackRock." These companies vote on behalf of their "equity holders," who are prevented from voting for themselves. There are many campaigns to apply pressure to financial intermediaries or change the rules of voting entirely, but they don’t typically require holding equity.

[9]: Many of the largest fossil fuel companies are nationally run, and do not have tradable equity. New equity dillutes “equity holder” profits whereas debt does not. Interest payments on debt are typically tax-deductible whereas profits paid out in dividends to equity holders are not. Recurring revenue and hard assets make it easier for fossil fuel companies to borrow debt at low interest rates.
