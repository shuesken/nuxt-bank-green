A few years later in 2019, two further credit facilities were established, the first worth $641 million USD "[with a syndicate of Japanese banks](https://www.enbridge.com/investment-center/reports-and-sec-filings/~/media/Enb/Documents/Investor%20Relations/2019/ENB_Q4_2019_MDAandFS.pdf)" and the second worth $500 million USD "[with an Asian bank](https://www.enbridge.com/investment-center/reports-and-sec-filings/~/media/Enb/Documents/Investor%20Relations/2019/ENB_Q4_2019_MDAandFS.pdf)". The identities of these banks weren’t made public.

Next came a whopping $2 billion USD bond, in November 2019. This bond was "underwritten" by a group of four banks, which means that they helped by raising $500 million USD each from various sources, then got paid for that help. The four banks were Barclays, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation.

Monumental loans followed in 2020. The first was worth \$1 billion USD and led by Mizuho, with a list of other lenders adding to the money pot. The full list wasn’t made public, but we do know that Bank of America, Royal Bank of Canada, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp and Toronto Dominion Bank were all heavily involved.

The other huge 2020 loan was worth \$2.975 billion CAD, this time with Toronto Dominion Bank as the main player.
